== 1.7.2 / 2008-01-16

== 1.7.1 / 2008-01-07
* Documentation improvements

== 1.7 / 2007-06-17
* Fix incorrect error message for multiple missing required arguments
  (thanks to Neill Zero)

== 1.6 / 2007-04-01
* Don't attempt curses screen-width magic unless running on a terminal.

== 1.5 / 2007-03-31
* --help and --version do the right thing even if the rest of the
  command line is incorrect.
* Added #conflicts and #depends to model dependencies and exclusivity
  between arguments.
* Minor bugfixes.

== 1.4 / 2007-03-26
* Disable short options with :short => :none.
* Minor bugfixes and error message improvements.

== 1.3 / 2007-01-31
* Wrap at (screen width - 1) instead of screen width.
* User can override --help and --version.
* Bugfix in handling of -v and -h.
* More tests to confirm the above.

== 1.2 / 2007-01-31
* Minor documentation tweaks.
* Removed hoe dependency.

== 1.1 / 2007-01-30
* Trollop::options now passes any arguments as block arguments. Since
  instance variables are not properly captured by the block, this
  makes it slightly less noisy to pass them in as local variables.
  (A real-life use for _why's cloaker!)
* Help display now preserves original argument order.
* Trollop::die now also has a single string form in case death is not
  due to a single argument.
* Parser#text now an alias for Parser#banner, and can be called
  multiple times, with the output being placed in the right position
  in the help text.
* Slightly more indicative formatting for parameterized arguments.

== 1.0 / 2007-01-29
* Initial release.
