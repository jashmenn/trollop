Trollop FAQ
-----------

Q: Whither Trollop?
A: There are more than a few pre-existing commandline argument
   processing libraries for Ruby. I was never too happy with any of
   them. They all seemed to want me to type way too much for what I
   wanted to get done. I just wanted to parse some options and be
   done with it.

Q: Whither "Trollop"?
A: No reason. Just thought it sounded funny.

Q: Why does Trollop disallow numeric short argument names, like '-1'
   and '-9'?
A: Because it's ambiguous whether these are arguments or negative
   integer or floating-point parameters to arguments. E.g., what
   about "-f -3". Is that a negative three parameter to -f, or two
   separate parameters? 

   I could be very clever and detect when there are no arguments
   that require floating-point parameters, and allow such short option
   names in those cases, but opted for simplicity and consistency.

Q: Why does Trollop disallow options appearing multiple times, despite
   the POSIX standard allowing it?
A: Because basically I think it's confusing, and more often than
   not, a symptom of you making a mistake (e.g. getting lost in a long
   command line and accidentally setting the same thing twice.) 
   I also don't see that much advantage to "-vvvvv" over "-v 5", so
   Trollop will produce an error if you try to use the same argument
   multiple times.
